# Go Study Repository

A comprehensive Go programming study guide designed for technical interview preparation and language mastery.

## Overview

This repository combines **Go language fundamentals** with **Data Structures and Algorithms** practice, providing both theoretical knowledge and hands-on problem-solving experience.

## Structure

### Concepts
Deep-dive explanations of Go's core concepts and internals:
- Arrays & Slices
- Concurrency & Goroutines  
- Channels
- Interfaces
- Error Handling
- Structs
- Garbage Collection
- Go Scheduler (M-P-G)
- Value vs Reference Types

### Data Structures & Algorithms
25+ LeetCode-style problems organized by category:
- **Arrays** - Two Sum, Best Time to Buy/Sell Stock, Container With Most Water
- **Dynamic Programming** - Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs, Coin Change
- **Graphs** - Number of Islands, Clone Graph, Course Schedule
- **Linked Lists** - Reverse, Merge Sorted Lists, Cycle Detection
- **Searching & Sorting** - Binary Search, Merge Sort, Quick Sort
- **Strings** - Longest Substring, Group Anagrams, Valid Palindrome
- **Trees** - Maximum Depth, Symmetric Tree, Validate BST

## How to Use

1. **Start with Concepts**: Review Go fundamentals in the `concepts/` directory
2. **Practice Problems**: Work through DSA problems in the `dsa/` directory
3. **Follow the Learning Path**: Use the recommended study order in `dsa/README.md`
4. **Run Tests**: Each problem includes comprehensive test cases

## Problem Structure

Each DSA problem contains:
- `description.md` - Problem statement, examples, and constraints
- `[problem_name]_test.go` - Test cases with function stubs

## Requirements

- Go 1.24.1+
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
