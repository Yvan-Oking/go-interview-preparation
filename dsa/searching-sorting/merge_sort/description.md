# Merge Sort

## Problem Description

Implement the Merge Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by dividing the array into two halves, sorting each half recursively, and then merging the sorted halves back together.


## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
Explanation: The array is sorted in ascending order using Merge Sort
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: [5, 2, 8, 1, 9]
Output: [1, 2, 5, 8, 9]
Explanation: The array is sorted in ascending order
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: [1]
Output: [1]
Explanation: Single element array is already sorted
```

## Constraints

- 1 <= arr.length <= 10^4
- -10^4 <= arr[i] <= 10^4
